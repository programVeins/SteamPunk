## Disclaimer

Hi, I am [Sabesh](https://github.com/programVeins/) and I created this theme in just over a day (initial version). I always wanted to have a theme that featured a steam punk environment but was not able to find one to my taste. So I rushed the process of production of a theme and covered areas that **I WORKED WITH** the most (JS and Python). Most extensions still work fine, but if you're facing an issue with an extension or feel like a modification could be made, feel free to open an issue/contribute. This is my first try at making a VSCode theme/ actually publishing a product to people out here so I could use all support I could get üéâ Thank you!
